# Introducation

The topic we wish to explore is the Generalized Additive Models. It is a powerful extension of the linear regression model that can capture complex nonlinear relationships between predictors and response variables, which allows for non-linear function of each variable, while maintaining their additivity. So, instead of $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2+...+\epsilon$, we would have a function of $y = \beta_0 + f_1(x_1) + f_2(x_2) + ... +\epsilon$, where $f(xi)$ represent a (smooth) non-linear function. They can also model interactions between variables and handle different types of data, including continuous, categorical, and ordinal variables.
